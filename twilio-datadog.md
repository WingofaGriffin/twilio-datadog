## Monitoring Your Twilio App With Datadog and Twilio

With Twilio's [Annual Signal Conference](https://signal.twilio.com/) having come to a conclusion October 1st, I thought it would be fitting to create an update to [the last blog post Datadog has done regarding how to use Twilio alongside Datadog made in 2014](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/send-alerts-sms-customizable-webhooks-twilio/). As a member of the [Twilio Champion Program](https://www.twilio.com/champions), my goal is to spread education and to inspire others to start creating, and what better way to do that alongside a product that will help you gather all of your data in one place.

In this blog post, I will outline how to use Datadog's comprehensive Synthetics suite to monitor your Twilio app's endpoints, as well as using the power of Twilio's API to send alerts through SMS on your monitors. So in the end you can use a Twilio notification to notify you if your Twilio app is down.
